**Assumptions and Limitations**
-----------------------------

* The project assumes that the healthcare facility has a stable internet connection and necessary infrastructure to support the system.
* The project assumes that Inventory Managers and Healthcare Staff have basic computer skills and are familiar with web-based applications.
* The project is limited to managing medical supplies and equipment within a single healthcare facility.
* The project does not include integration with external systems or third-party services.

**Scalability Considerations**
---------------------------

* The system is designed to manage up to 10,000 inventory items, with capabilities to scale up to handle larger datasets.
* The system is optimized for performance and efficiency, ensuring fast data retrieval and processing.
* The system is designed for horizontal scaling, allowing for easy addition of new servers or instances to handle increased traffic or demand.
* The system is designed for modular architecture, allowing for easy maintenance, updates, and replacement of individual components.
